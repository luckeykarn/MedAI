# ü©∫ AI-Based Medical Diagnosis System

This system models the clinical and data relationships needed to power AI-assisted diagnosis, patient management, and clinical research. It is normalized, extensible, and designed to support both traditional medical records and modern AI/ML pipelines.

---

## üìö Overview

The database schema includes structured representations of:

- Diseases and their medical/biological metadata  
- Symptoms, causes, treatments, and preventions  
- Hospitals, doctors, and patient cases  
- Medicine prescriptions  
- AI-generated diagnoses with confidence scoring

---

## üß¨ Core Medical Entities

### `Disease`
Represents a medical condition.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | The primary name of the disease |
| `description` | Free-text medical description |
| `ontology_description` | Formal description from ontologies like MONDO |
| `uniprot_description` | Protein function info from UniProt (if applicable) |
| `mondo_id`, `icd_10_code`, `icd_11_code` | Standardized identifiers |
| `protein_count`, `direct_association_count` | Research-based associations |
| `is_rare`, `is_chronic`, `is_hereditary`, `is_contagious` | Medical flags for classification |
| `severity_level` | Ranges from mild to critical |
| `typical_age_onset` | Typical age when disease manifests |
| `gender_prevalence` | Prevalence between genders |
| `diagnostic_confidence_threshold` | Minimum AI confidence required for a valid suggestion |

---

## ‚öïÔ∏è Medical Relationships

These define how diseases relate to other entities:

- **`DiseaseSymptom`**: Links diseases to symptoms with frequency and specificity scores.
- **`DiseaseCause`**: Links diseases to causes (genetic, environmental, etc.).
- **`DiseaseTreatment`**: Suggested or validated treatments for a disease.
- **`DiseasePrevention`**: Preventive strategies, e.g., vaccination or lifestyle changes.

---

## üè• Healthcare Infrastructure

### `Hospital`
Represents a physical or virtual healthcare institution.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Name of the hospital |
| `location`, `contact_email`, `contact_phone` | Basic metadata |

### `Doctor`
A healthcare provider working at a hospital.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `user` | Linked to Django's built-in user |
| `specialty` | e.g., Pediatrics, Oncology |
| `hospital` | The hospital where the doctor practices |

---

## üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Patient Cases

### `PatientCase`
Represents a single patient's diagnostic record.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `user` | Optionally linked to an authenticated user |
| `hospital`, `doctor` | Who and where the case was managed |
| `age`, `gender` | Demographic info for filtering AI logic |
| `is_emergency` | Emergency flag determined by symptoms or AI |
| `created_at` | Timestamp of report creation |

Linked through:
- `PatientSymptom`: each reported symptom, its severity, and duration
- `AIDiagnosis`: diseases suggested by AI
- `Prescription`: medicines recommended by doctor

---

## üíä Medicines & Prescriptions

### `Medicine`
Structured reference list of pharmacological agents.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Commercial or generic name |
| `description` | Free-text or drug-class detail |
| `common_dosage` | e.g., 500mg, 10ml |

### `Prescription`
Prescribed medicine details for a patient case.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `doctor`, `patient_case`, `medicine` | Core relationships |
| `dosage`, `frequency`, `duration_days` | Dosing instructions |
| `notes`, `prescribed_at` | Optional notes and timestamp |

---

## ü§ñ AI Diagnosis

### `AIDiagnosis`
Tracks which diseases the AI suggested for a given patient case.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `patient_case`, `disease` | Linked case and suggested disease |
| `confidence_score` | AI's numeric certainty (0.0‚Äì1.0) |
| `rank` | Relative position in suggested list |
| `explanation` | Reasoning or key features used |

---

## üß† Clinical Intelligence Ready

This schema is designed to support:

- Clinical reasoning (symptom-based diagnosis)
- AI/ML pipelines (confidence thresholds, training data)
- Structured medical records
- Multi-center data analysis (via hospital linkage)

---

## üìà Future Extensions

This system can be extended to include:

- Lab tests, imaging, and biomarkers  
- Genetic variants (e.g., SNPs, WGS data)  
- Patient follow-ups and outcome tracking  
- Clinical trials and research tags  
- Interoperability standards like HL7/FHIR

---

## üìé Example Use Case Flow

1. **Doctor at Hospital A** logs a new `PatientCase`.
2. Patient reports symptoms via UI or API.
3. AI model computes `AIDiagnosis` with ranked diseases.
4. Doctor reviews and prescribes `Medicine`.
5. Data feeds back into model retraining.

|-------------|---------|
| AI Engineers | Clean, labeled training data |
| Clinicians | Structured diagnostic tool |
| Researchers | Epidemiological and symptom linkage |
| Developers | Scalable, normalized architecture |
